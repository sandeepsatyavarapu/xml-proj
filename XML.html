        <p  style="margin-left:240px;">mined threshold, and small changes to the input can have a dramatic effect on the output
            (Groth, 2000). The activation function can be very sensitive to missing data.
            </p>
        <p  style="margin-left:240px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s take this a step further. The activation function of the basic unit of a neural
network has two sub-functions: the combination function and the transfer function.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:240px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination function commonly uses the “standard weighted sum” (the
summation of the input attribute values multiplied by the weights that have been
assigned to those attributes) to calculate a value to be passed on to the transfer function.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:240px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer function applies either a linear or non-linear function to the value
passed to it by the combination function. Even though a linear function used in a feedforward neural network is simply performing a linear regression, missing values can
distort the coefficients in the regression equation and therefore pass on invalid values
as output (Berry & Linoff, 1997).</p>
         <p style="margin-left:240px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the linear and non-linear function types is the most commonly used
transfer function: the S-Shaped Sigmoid Function. This function represents a gradual
change from a linear model to a non-linear model and is the transfer function most
commonly used in “off the shelf” neural network packages. Since the result of the
combination function is usually between –1 and 1, the function is deemed “near-linear”
and satisfies most linear and non-linear applications. However, the impact of missing
data on the sigmoid function goes back to how the combination function derives its value
              for the sigmoid function to act upon (Skapura, 1995).</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center">FUTURE FUNDS</h1>
          <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor data quality has plagued the knowledge discovery process and all associated
data-mining techniques. Future data-mining systems should be sensitive to noise and
have the ability to deal with all types of pollution, both internally and in conjunction with
end-users. As data gathers noise, the system should only reduce the level of confidence
associated with the results provided and not “suddenly alter” the direction of discovery.
We cannot dismiss the dangers of blind data mining that can deteriorate into a datadredging process. Systems should still produce the most significant findings from the
data set possible, even if noise is present. Systems will be robust against uncertainty
              and missing data issues (Fayyad & Piatetsky-Shapiro, 1996).</p>
            <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As software products evolve and new data-mining algorithms are developed,
alternative methods for the identification and deletion/replacement of missing data will
also be developed. New hybrid methodologies for dealing with noisy data will continue
to evolve as end-users uncover previously undiscovered patterns of missing data within
their applications. Commonality of patterns discovered within a particular industry
should result in the sharing of new methodologies for dealing with these discoveries.
Warehousing missing data patterns and allowing end-users the capability of selecting
and testing a variety of patterns and imputation methods will become commonplace, inhouse and in the public domain.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As software products evolve and new data-mining algorithms are developed,

             <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As data mining continues to evolve and mature as a viable business tool, it will be
monitored to address its role in the technological life cycle. While data mining is currently
regarded as being at the third stage of a six-stage maturity process in technological
evolution, it will soon gain momentum and grow into the area of Early Majority. The
maturity stages include:</p>
        </center>
        <ul style="margin-left: 230px">
  <li>Innovators;</li>
  <li>Early Adopters;</li>
  <li>Chasm;</li>
  <li>Early Majority;</li>
  <li>Late Majority; and</li>
  <li>Laggards.</li>
</ul>
        <br>
       <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The “chasm” stage is characterized by various hurdles and challenges that must be
met before the technology can become widely accepted as mainstream. As tools for the
preprocessing and cleansing of noisy data continue to be proven to be effective,
advancement toward a level of “early majority” (where the technology becomes mature
           and is generally accepted and used) will be accomplished.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools for dealing with missing data will also grow from being used as a horizontal
solution (not designed to provide business-specific end solutions) into a type of vertical
solution (integration of domain-specific logic into data mining solutions). As the
gigabyte-, terabyte-, and petabyte-size data sets become more prevalent in data warehousing applications, the issue of dealing with missing data will itself become an integral
solution for the use of such data rather than simply existing as a component of the
            knowledge discovery and data mining processes (Han & Kamber, 2001).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As in other maturing applications, missing or incomplete data will be looked upon
as a global issue. Finding clues to terrorist activities will be uncovered by utilizing textual
data-mining techniques for incomplete and unstructured data (Sullivan, 2001). For
instance, monitoring links and searching for trends between news reports from commercial news services may be used to glean clues from items in cross-cultural environments
that might not otherwise be available.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the issue of statistical analysis with missing data has been addressed
since the early 1970s (Little & Rubin, 1987), the advent of data warehousing, knowledge
discovery, data mining, and data cleansing has brought the concept of dealing with
missing data into the limelight. Costs associated with the deletion of data will make the
imputation of data a focal point for independent data-sleuthing entities. For example, an
independent firm involved in the restructuring of incomplete data sets will be able to
obtain or purchase fragmented data that has been deemed unusable by mainstream
corporations and produce complete data with a level of support worthy of use in actual
production environments</p>
       <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  An extended topic in this arena will be the ownership of such newly created data
sets and/or algorithms and imputation methods that are discovered within an application
or industry. What if an independent firm discovers new knowledge based on findings
from data sets that were originally incomplete and made available by outside firms? Are
the discoveries partially owned by both firms? It is up to the legal system and the parties
           involved to sort out these issues.</p>
         <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be seen that future generations of data miners will be faced with many
challenges concerning the issues of missing data. As the industry as a whole continues
to evolve and mature, so will end-user expectations of having various, readily available
             methods of dealing with missing data .</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center">CONCLUSIONS</h2>
         <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues concerning the impact of inconsistent data and missing data are a fact
of life in the world of knowledge discovery and data mining. They must be faced with
rigor by developers of new data-mining applications before viable decisions can be
developed by the end-users of these systems.</p>
         <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following a background analysis and literature review of missing data concepts, the
authors addressed reasons for data inconsistency. Included in the discussion were
procedural factors, refusal of response, and inapplicable questions. Following was the
classification of missing data types into the areas of (data) missing at random (MAR),
(data) missing completely at random (MCAR), non-ignorable missing data ,and outliers
treated as missing data. Next, a review of existing methods for addressing the problem
of missing data was conducted for the deletion of cases or variables and various
imputation methods. Imputation methods included were case substitution, mean
substitution, cold deck imputation, hot deck imputation, regression imputation, and
multiple imputation.</p>
         <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of missing data on various data mining algorithms was then addressed.
The algorithms reviewed included k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Association
Rules, and Neural Networks</p>
         <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the authors offered their opinions on future developments and trends that
developers of knowledge discovery software can expect to face, and the needs of endusers when confronted with the issues of data inconsistency and missing data.</p>
         <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the goal of the authors that the issues of inconsistent data and missing data
be exposed to individuals new to the venues of knowledge discovery and data mining.
It is a topic worthy of research and investigation by developers of fresh data-mining
applications, as well as a method of review for systems that have already been developed
or that are currently under construction.</p>
         <p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspThis concludes the chapter concerning the impact of missing data on data mining.
It is our sincere hope that readers of this topic have gained a fresh perspective for the
necessity of data consistency and an exposure to alternatives for dealing with the issues
of missing data.</p>
